It is also important to call `super().__init__(trajectory)` to pass the trajectory to the base class so that the `run()` method works.\n",
    "- the `_prepare` function needs to setup the required data structures (lists, dicts etc) which later functions expect.  These won't be visible to the users, but are used to save intermediate values.  Remember that these need to be stored as \"`self.X`\" to be persistant to the class.\n",
    "- the `_single_frame` calculates the value of interest for a single given frame. Moving between frames is handled by the `run()` function.\n",
    "- `_conclude()` is called at the end to finalise everything.  At this point the data structure created in `_prepare` have been populated by many calls to `_single_frame`, and now these must be reduced to our final values in `.results`.\n",

    "\n",
    "A proposed solution is given below.\n",
    "\n",
    "One trick that has been used is that it is more efficient to calculate many distance at once in a single call to `calc_bonds` rather than calling this function once for each chain.\n",
