### Note:
The `parallelism.ipynb` notebook refers a multi-Gb set of large .xtc trajectories
of 7000+ frames. We provide here a shorter (200-frame) segment of the same system,
with solvent removed (`short_traj.xtc`). The accompanying `short.tpr` has also had
its solvent removed, so that it is compatible with `short_traj.xtc`.
